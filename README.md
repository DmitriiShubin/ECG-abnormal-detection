## Summary

This repository demonstrates ability to improve the target metring of the Deep Neural Network through the **Sub-Band Decomposition** - the method of the time-series pre-processing.

Applications:

* Audio processing, voice recognition, GAN-based de-noising, personalized audio Deep Networks
* Time-series forcasting (Energy consumption, stock prices, real-estate prices)
* Time-series segmentation (seq2seq, 1D-Unet, 1D-Vgg, etc.)
* Time-series regression and classification (biological, RF signals)
